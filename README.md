PostgreSQL: Views, Sub-Queries and Functions

I practiced using SQL and relationships;
I used different types and foreign keys;
I learned how to write and execute Sub-Queries;
I used functions to work with Strings, Data and Formulas; 
Finally, I generated views based on the SELECT command in different situations.
